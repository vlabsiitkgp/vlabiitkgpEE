                                <li>When the page gets loaded two buttons with values "Click to display the
                                    functioning of Voltage Multiplier" & "Click to stop the
                                    functioning of Voltage Multiplier" are displayed.</li><br/>

                                <li>The first button is clicked to display the functioning of the Voltage Multiplier & the second button is clicked to stop the functioning of the same.</li>

                                <li>The input parameters are Current (in &micro;A), Frequency (in Hz), Capacitance 
                                    (in &micro;F) and these are associated with corresponding text boxes which are displayed.</li><br/>

                                <li>The input values of each of these variables to be entered should be within 
                                    the range specified.</li><br/>

                                <li>Upon entering the values of all the variables, the "Calculate drop and ripple"
                                    button is clicked to display the computed ripple and drop values. 
                                    This calculation of drop and ripple is for a set of values of Current 
                                    (in &micro;A), Frequency (in Hz), Capacitance (in &micro;F)In addition, the variation of one of the above parameters on the ripple
                                    voltage can also be studied.</li><br/>

                                <li>The parameters that have to be varied are shown to 
                                    the user on the right pane.The user have to choose the parameter to vary from the list & click on the
									"Choose Parameter to vary" button. Only this parameter is varied while the others are
                                    kept constant during the experiment.</li><br/>

                                <li>To begin with the user enters the appropriate values
                                    of all the parameters and calculates the drop and ripple
                                    as mentioned in step 5.</li><br/>

                                <li>Step 5 is repeated by changing the value of the desired parameter
                                    only. The other parameters which are constant cannot be edited.</li><br/>

                                <li>Steps 8 and 9 can be repeated for a range of the parameter 
                                    that is being varied.</li><br/>

                                <li>After calculating the drop and ripple for six values the
                                    user is prompted with the "Show Graph" button.</li><br/>

                                <li>The "Show Graph" button is clicked to depict the graph
                                    for the parameter chosen versus calculated drop and ripple.</li><br/>

                                <li>These steps can be repeated for other parameters.</li><br/>
